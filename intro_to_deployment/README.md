**Explore and process data**
1. Retrieve - getting the raw data 
2. Clean and explore - Explore and visualize the data to identify the most prominent features. 
    * Remove outliers or mistakes
3. Prepare/transform
    * Most Machine Learning models expect standardized data values. Therefore, this step often involves normalizing and converting the format of the data. 
    * In addition, split the data into training, validation, and test datasets. 
  
  **Modeling**
  1. Develop and train the model using the training dataset. 
  2. Final step of modeling is to evaluate and validate the model. In this step, you'll tune the model using the validation dataset. 
  3. Finally, evaluate the model by using the test dataset. 
  
  **Deployment**
  
  Deployment, monitoring, and updating the model in the production environment.
  1. Deployment
      * Make your model available for use by web or software application. 
  2. Monitor and update model and data

* How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?

* What is cloud computing?

* Why would we use cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?

* Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?

* What does it mean for a model to be deployed?

* What are the essential characteristics associated with the code of deployed models?
